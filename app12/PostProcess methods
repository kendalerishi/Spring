In case if we are using more than one  PostProcessor classes then we have to implement Ordered interface. 
Bean obj and Bean name (id) are passed to these methods as an argument
Define getOrder() which returns int numner ie. order
Provide config details id and name for both PostProcessor classes in xml file.
We can write PostProcessor class inside Bean class 
Also , it will reduce a .class file but it will make the code more complex.
validation code inside PostProcessAfterInitialization() method only. 
Because BeforeInitialization()-there is change of overriding data during initialization.
