In this application we are injecting various value types in bean class. 
Here we have defined data types as List, Map and Set which are interfaces. 
We are directly printing their values ie. values of interfaces? 

How is it possible?
Spring framework internally implements these Interfaces,
create their objects and return it to application. 
If we go through Spring framework source code then it will give implementation classes.
