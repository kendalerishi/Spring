Account Operations application final using Xml config and single Test (controller) class
Switch case 3 --- Here user will enter account number to be updated. First we need to find whether the account exists or not. 
If exists, we need to display each account item(name, type etc.) and get new value for each one.
There is a possibility that user will only press enter(null value) and do not want to change the old value for any of the item.
To tackle this situation we have to introduce a new getAccount() in DAo class and implement it. This method will create 2 objects: 
1 with old values and 
another with new values set by user, Whenever user enters null for any value then we will assign old value to that parameter.
Once we get a set of parameters to be updated then we will call updateAccount().
