If we inject dependent values to the Bean object through Constructor then this type of Dependency Injection is called 
as "Constructor Dependency Injection".
If we want to use constructor dependency injection in Spring applications , 
first we have to declare the respective parameterized constructor in the corresponmding bean class then 
we have to declare that constructor arguments in spring configuration file 
by using the following tags.


<beans>
<bean ..... >
<constructor-arg value="--"/>
<constructor-arg> value </constructor-arg>
</bean>
----
</beans>
