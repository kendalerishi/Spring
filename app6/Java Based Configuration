Needs to add aop related library files.

app7 --- errors --- org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No bean named  
'beanHello' available
method name acts id attribute value (we provide only one id in xml file)
but we can pass more than one name attribute values. how to pass in Java based config?
    
    @Bean(name={"bean1","bean2","bean3"})
	public HelloBean helloBean() {
		
		return new HelloBean();
	}

Scope in Java based config
Bydefault scope is singleton

@Bean(name={"bean1","bean2"})
@Scope("prototype")
	public HelloBean helloBean() {
		
		return new HelloBean();
	}
But when we have more than 1 Beans then Singleton scope object has 1st priority of creation then Prototype  
scope.



Bean life cycle :
1. Bean Class Loading
2. Bean Instantiation
3. Bean Initialization
4. Bean Destruction



2. Bean Instantiation
Regular Bean obj creation with application context.
Here Bean class constructor may be public or default or private. No matter, IOC container will find it  
since IOC container uses Reflection API.
